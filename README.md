# Map Data Across the Globe
[The final project in Data Visualization section on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-national-contiguity-with-a-force-directed-graph)

User Stories:

* I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
* I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
* I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Additinally you can rotate, zoom and drag the globe as well as filter meteorite strikes by years.
